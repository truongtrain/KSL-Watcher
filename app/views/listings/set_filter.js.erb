// TODO 2.1 - add javascript to replace the contents of the table body
// with a new rendering of the listing_table_body partial view template.
// Remember to pass @listings to the partial view template as a local var named 'listings'.
// Also remember to escape the view's rendering using 'j' which is short for escape_javascript.
// Here's a example:
//  $(<some jQuery selector>).html('<%= j render <partial name>, var_in_partial: @object_instance_var %>');
console.log('rerendered the body of the table');

// TODO 2.2 - add javascript to replace the contents of the selection widget 
// with a new rendering of the filter_buttons partial view template.
// This will look very similar to the code above but you don't need to pass any variables down
// to the partial in this case.
console.log('rerendered the filter buttons');

// Remember that you can identify exactly which element to replace and which
// partial template to render by looking at the index.html.erb file to see how
// the page was created initially.
