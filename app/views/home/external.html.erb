    Welcome to the KSLWatcher!
  </p>
  <p>
    This service will keep an eye on the KSL Classifieds for you and alert
    you when a new listing of interest appears.  Using this system means:
      <ul>
        <li>
          More free time -- no longer do you need to visit KSL regularly to check for that unopened BeeGees vinyl record you've been pining after.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fewer lost opportunities -- don't lose out to someone who's spending all their time scanning the KSL site while you do real work in the real world.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </p>
